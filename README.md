MA678 Midterm Project Proposal


Why this topic?

As CoViD-19 pandemic hits most parts of the world, it is radically changing many aspects of our lives, including teaching and learning. More education switched to online. This is a new opportunity to transform how knowledge is passed to students. 

For my personal career goals, I believe online education is an exciting and fast-growing industry, which would need data analysis to improve its effectiveness in teaching. If the online learning model has proven to be effective, it can be applied in regions that lack adequate teaching resources. If online education can reduce some inequality, so that students from underprivileged backgrounds have a higher chance of coming on top, then I can contribute to this industry and help make a positive impact.

Question: 
How can we predict students’ future performance? What factors impact students’ test accuracy? What kind of lecture (format, duration) most effectively helps students to absorb knowledge?

Data Source:
Data is supplied by Riid! Kaggle competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction/data

We have data on each student’s historical performance(correctness to previous questions), other student’s performance on the same test questions, whether previous test questions have explanations, how much time each student spent on each question, what kind of lectures they watched, ect.


Proposed Timeline of work:
EDA: due on Thursday, Nov 12.
Data Processing: due on Wednesday, Nov 18.
Modeling and Validation: due on Sunday, Nov 29.
Write-up: due on Dec 1st.
